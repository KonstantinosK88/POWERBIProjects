Daily Returns = (Stock Price / Previous Day's Stock Price) - 1

Let's break down the DAX formula step by step:

Daily Returns = 
DIVIDE(
    MAX('Apple'[Close]) - CALCULATE(MAX('Apple'[Close]), 'Apple'[Date] = MAX('Apple'[Date]) - 1),
    CALCULATE(MAX('Apple'[Close]), 'Apple'[Date] = MAX('Apple'[Date]) - 1)
)

   - MAX('Apple'[Close]): This part of the formula calculates the maximum (latest) closing price in the 'Close' column of the 'Apple' table.

   - CALCULATE(MAX('Apple'[Close]), 'Apple'[Date] = MAX('Apple'[Date]) - 1): This part calculates the maximum closing price for the previous day. 
     It uses the CALCULATE function to modify the context of the calculation. It finds the maximum closing price where the date is equal to the 
     maximum date minus 1 day.

   - MAX('Apple'[Close]) - CALCULATE(MAX('Apple'[Close]), 'Apple'[Date] = MAX('Apple'[Date]) - 1): This subtracts the closing price of the previous 
     day from the closing price of the current day.

   - DIVIDE(..., CALCULATE(MAX('Apple'[Close]), 'Apple'[Date] = MAX('Apple'[Date]) - 1)): The DIVIDE function is used to handle potential division 
     by zero. It divides the result from step 3 by the closing price of the previous day.

In summary, the formula calculates the daily return by taking the difference between the closing price of the current day and the closing price of 
the previous day, and then dividing it by the closing price of the previous day. This gives the daily return as a decimal, which can be converted 
to a percentage by multiplying by 100 if needed. The use of the MAX function is a common approach to get the latest values in a column.
